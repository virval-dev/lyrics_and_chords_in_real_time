# lyrics_and_chords_in_real_time
This web app will have a library of different songs lyrics and mostly guitar chords. The catch is that they're displayed in real time using timed tempo and rhythm. The app is supposed to be an Open Source project, where everyone who's interested can take part. The main thing is that this app is made by musician to musicians.
